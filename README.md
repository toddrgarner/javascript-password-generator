## Java Password Generator

```
The password generator application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The application validates the user's input and ensures that at least one character type is selected. Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. This application is also responsive, ensuring the application adapts to multiple screen sizes.
